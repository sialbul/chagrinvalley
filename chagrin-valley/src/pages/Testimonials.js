                    <p>Chagrin Valley Early Learning Center is great! The rooms are bright and clean. They offer excellent activities for the kids and the outdoor space is huge! All of the teachers are kind and really care about the children. My kids look forward to going to Chagrin Valley Early Center everyday and I know they are well taken care of and learn a lot while they are there.</p>

                    <p>We love Chagrin Valley Early Learning Center. We have one in the infant room and one in the toddler room. We couldn't ask for a safer and nurturing environment for our kids. The teachers are all so warm and our children are always so well taken care of. Highly recommend!</p>
