            <p>We at Chagrin Valley ELC know how much your little one means to you. That is why we have created a safe and nurturing environment in which your little one can explore both themselves and their world. We understand how hard it is to juggle
                career and family especially when worrying about an infant. CVELC offers a home-like experience where we work with each childâ€™s individual schedule and meet their needs accordingly. A shoe-free environment keeps their little hands and
                mouth safe from germs and dirt while they discover the world.With the combination of first rate care and loving caregivers, CVELC is the next best thing to home!
            </p>
            <p>Sample of the Daily Schedule We do not have an infant schedule because we feel that infants should be talked to and played with on their own schedules, but we transition 16 months old infants on cots and once a day naps to prepare them for
                the Toddler room.We feel that infants should be fed when they are hungry, sleep when they are tired, and they should be changed and clean. They should be rocked, held, sung to, and read to when they are awake. Infants need words, songs,
                rhymes, language development, exercise/stimulation, colorful things and black and white pictures. Infants need love and enjoyment every day. Diapering Policy is to change every 2 hours, unless needed.
