                            We at Chagrin Valley ELC know how much your little
                            one means to you.That is why we have created a safe

                            understand how hard it is to juggle career and
                            family especially when worrying about an
                            infant.CVELC offers a home - like experience where
                            we work with each childâ€™ s individual schedule and

                            environment keeps their little hands and mouth safe
                            from germs and dirt while they discover the
                            world.With the combination of first rate care and

                            Sample of the Daily Schedule We do not have an
                            infant schedule because we feel that infants should
                            be talked to and played with on their own schedules,
                            but we transition 16 months old infants on cots and
                            once a day naps to prepare them for the Toddler
                            room.We feel that infants should be fed when they
                            are hungry, sleep when they are tired, and they
                            should be changed and clean.They should be rocked,
                            held, sung to, and read to when they are
                            awake.Infants need words, songs, rhymes, language
                            development, exercise / stimulation, colorful things
                            and black and white pictures.Infants need love and
                            enjoyment every day.Diapering Policy is to change
                            every 2 hours, unless needed.{" "}
